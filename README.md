# 👋 Hi, I’m Pilar!

👩🏻‍💻🔭🧮 I’m a physicist and mathematician pursuing my **M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Technische Universität München**, specialising on **scientific computing**, **optimization**, and **artificial intelligence**. I enjoy using mathematics to bridge theory and application: from abstract models to data-driven and real-world impact.

🤖 My current interests include **scientific computing**, **quantum computing** and **robotics** — stay tuned for upcoming projects!

📫 **Let’s connect:**  
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) — I’d love to exchange ideas or collaborate on cool projects :)
